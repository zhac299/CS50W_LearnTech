# CS50W LearnTech

An original project idea that I developed as part of CS50W. This Django project functions as an online learning platform where there are two user types - student and teacher. Each account types has different permissions for instance a teacher account can upload courses and edit them whereas a student account cannot do this.

A video of this project in action can be seen here:
